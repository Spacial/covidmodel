# Modeling <span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span>

This site provides guidance on the efficiency of COVID-19 mitigation
efforts. Weâ€™ve implemented a model for the spread of the virus and fit
the parameters to data at the country level from the US and Europe. We
then have created state-level dashboards to help guide decision-making
when it comes to mitigation efforts and ICU capacity. You can read more
about the model <Link href="/about"><a className="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-500 leading-relaxed font-medium mb-8">here</a></Link>.
