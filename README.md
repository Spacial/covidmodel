# COVID Modeling Project

This model is intended to provide guidance on the efficiency of COVID-19 mitigation efforts.

Weâ€™ve implemented a model for the spread of the virus and fit the parameters to data at the country level from the US and Europe. We then have created state-level dashboards to help guide decision-making when it comes to mitigation efforts and ICU capacity. You can read more about the model [here](https://covidmodelingproject.com/about).
